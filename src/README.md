The title of project is: Task Manager App.
I wrote the application in VS Code and configured a connection to the database in Flask in the app.py file, which is connected to the MySQL database using the db_config variable.
I uploaded the tables I created in MySQL Workbench in addition to the code as a separate file.
The code that I did manage to write focuses mainly on the login page and landing page.
All the code is connected to my GitHub: github.com/DanielShahar , and I ran the program through Vircel.
